# fix vanguard

i randomly get an error that just says "we could not isntall a required dependency"

this happens because vanguard takes a big old shit in its big boy pants and can't close a handle to a file (i think, i actually have no idea)

the way i fix it is:

1. run `fixvanguard.bat`
2. let it do its thing
3. let it reboot your pc or do it yourself (doesn't matter, you just need to reboot)
4. open your riot client
5. let vanguard redownload
6. reboot your pc again
7. done :)

that's pretty much all there is to it
